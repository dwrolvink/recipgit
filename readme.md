# Recipgit
Recipgit is an intended standard for an opensource recipe book, with webapp included.

Everyone can host their own instance of the webapp, even locally. See [installation instructions](docs/installation.md).

> An example of the webapp is also hosted here: [https://recipes.dwrolvink.com](recipes.dwrolvink.com).

The main star of the show is the `/book/` folder, this houses all the recipes. A standard for how the recipes are created should allow anyone to make their own webapp with the book folder as a source for the recipes.

The webapp included in this repo follows the principle that web1.0 was better in many regards. It tries to minimize page size, use no javascript nor cookies. *Just readable html.* See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) to learn more.
